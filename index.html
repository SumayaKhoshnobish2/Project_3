    <p id = "caption">Nikola Tesla was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist best known for 
        his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system.</p>

        <h2 id ="headline">Tesla's Life</h2>
        <p>Nikola Tesla accomplished more in his lifetime than many of us could ever hope to achieve in a 100 lifetimes. 
            Tesla held over 300 different patents, spanning several countries. From wireless technology to alternating current, 
            electric motors, Radio, X-Rays, radar and laser technology…the list goes on. Nikola Tesla’s work would go on to inspire thousands of inventors, dreamers and engineers. 
            To this very day, his inventions continue to shape life as we know it. You can’t help but wonder what the world would have looked like today if Nikola Tesla 
            would have been able to finish his experiments with free energy and long range wireless energy transfer.</p>
        
        <h2>Achievemets</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>In 1887, Tesla came up with an induction motor that was operated by alternating current, 
                a form of power that was becoming common in Europe and the USA. </li>
            <li>After 1890, Tesla researched various approaches to transmitting power by inductive and capacitive coupling. 
                This was through the use of AC voltages that were produced by his famous `Tesla coil.` </li>
            <li>In mid 1891, at the age of 35, he became a naturalized citizen of the US. In the same year, he also patented his famous Tesla Coil.</li>
            <li>He came up with fluorescent bulbs in his lab 40 years before they became a standard in the consumer market. </li>
            <li>One of his greatest inventions which has become popular by the electric car that brandishes his name. </li>
